# Java Console Application   
## Introduction
 This project is a collaborative effort by a group of students as part of a school assignment. 
 The purpose of this Java console application is to facilitate the registration process for school camps.
 
 This project uses a Console-based user interface using Java language and SOLID principles are applied. 
 ## Features
 **User Registration:** Students can register for upcoming school camps by providing necessary details such as Name, Faculty, Student ID, Camp Preferences, etc.

**Camp Information:** Users can access information about available camps, including Dates, Locations, Registration Date, etc. Camp Committee Members can create camps and update the relevant details.

**Enquires & Suggestions:** Students can submit, and edit enquires and suggestions. Camp Committee Members can view and reply to enquires and suggestions.

**Data Storage:** As databases are not permitted in this project, we instead used Excel to store our data (Installation of Apache POI required https://archive.apache.org/dist/poi/release/bin/poi-bin-5.2.3-20220909.zip).  

## How to use:

1. Clone the Repository
2. Compile the code and run MainApp.Java
3. Refer to the Excel sheet (student_list.xlsx or staff_list.xlsx for sample User ID and password)
4. Once logged in, you can select options from the MENU.
